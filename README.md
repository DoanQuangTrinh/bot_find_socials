# bot_find_socials
Find Twitter and Facebook accounts. 

# Instruction

1. Open the input excel sheet file, enter the CEO/President's name, company name and other relevant keywords related to the search. 
2. dist -> find_socials -> find_socials.exe 
3. Run the application. Input the input excel file and run it. To prevent google from detecting that you are running a script, input and run the data by batches. For example, 30-40 profiles in each run, whatever amount that does not trigger the bot detection. 
4. It will generate the Twitter and/or Facebook excel sheet which contains the link to the CEO's social media accounts. 
5. You are advised to manually check the links as not all CEOs have social media accounts. Some are fake accounts set up by other users.
